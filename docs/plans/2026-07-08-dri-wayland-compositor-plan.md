## §1. The decision

After landing SDL2 (plan 7 / PR #709, the last foundation milestone), the
project pivots the **compositor and userland** half of DRI from a bespoke
in-house wire protocol to **Wayland**, the Linux-standard display protocol.

Two locked decisions (confirmed with the user):

1. **Wayland-first — REPLACE the custom compositor.** The unbuilt custom
   compositor (`wpkcompositor` + `libwpkclient` + the 24-message custom
   wire of dri-design §9.2) is dropped before it is written. Kandelo's own
   seed apps become **Wayland clients** speaking the real protocol.

2. **Own Wayland-native apps first.** v1 ships a thin in-house toolkit
   (`libkwl`) over `libwayland-client`, and Kandelo-authored apps on top of
   it. Running *unmodified* upstream GTK/Qt applications is a real,
   explicitly-named goal but is scoped **post-v1** (it pulls in glib,
   cairo, pango, pixman, and full libffi — see §7).

**Why Wayland.** Adopting the Linux-standard protocol means (a) Kandelo's
future apps are portable to real Linux and real Wayland compositors, (b)
the eventual GTK/Qt app-compat milestone reuses the same compositor rather
than needing a second protocol bridge, and (c) we validate the kernel's
Unix primitives (AF_UNIX + SCM_RIGHTS + epoll) against a large, real,
unmodified C codebase (`libwayland`) instead of a codebase we wrote to fit
what the kernel already does.

---

## §2. Feasibility — every kernel primitive Wayland needs already exists

This was verified against the kernel during exploration and is **not** open
work. The pivot rests on it:

| Wayland needs | Kernel has it | Where |
|---|---|---|
| AF_UNIX stream sockets (bind/listen/accept/accept4/connect/socketpair, `SOCK_CLOEXEC`/`SOCK_NONBLOCK`) | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/unix_socket.rs`, `syscalls.rs` ~7252–7550 |
| `SCM_RIGHTS` fd-passing via `sendmsg`/`recvmsg` ancillary data | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/wasm_api.rs` ~6342–6674 (`extract_scm_rights` / `install_scm_rights_fds`) |
| `poll`/`pselect6`/`ppoll`/`epoll_create1`/`epoll_ctl`/`epoll_wait`/`eventfd2`/`timerfd`/`signalfd` | ✅ | `syscalls.rs` |
| **Blocking that actually parks** — kernel returns `EAGAIN`, host worker parks + retries on event wakes with a 1 ms fallback, so `libwayland`'s epoll `wl_event_loop` runs directly | ✅ | `syscalls.rs:7928–7944`, `:9491`; `host/src/kernel-worker.ts:242,2222,2509` |
| GBM prime-fd / dumb-bo allocation + mmap | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/dri/bo.rs`, `syscalls.rs` ~809–1013 |
| KMS single-CRTC + vblank/page-flip pump | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/dri/mod.rs` `drain_pending_flips`, `syscalls.rs` ~1219–1614 |
| N-guest→1-host GL multiplexer | ✅ | `host/src/webgl/muxer.ts`, `submit-queue.ts` |
| evdev input | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/input/` |
| ALSA audio | ✅ | `crates/kernel/src/audio/` |

The single hardest feasibility worry — *does a blocking `epoll_wait`/`poll`
inside a real C event loop actually suspend and resume?* — is resolved: it
does. `libwayland`'s `wl_event_loop` is an epoll loop, and it runs unmodified.

**GPU-tier note.** `DRM_IOCTL_WPK_CREATE_GPU_BO` / `WPK_BIND_FOREIGN_TEXTURE`
constants exist (`crates/shared/src/lib.rs` ~2192–2199) but are **not
dispatched** yet. v1 compositing therefore uses `wl_shm` (CPU tier): the
client renders into a dumb-bo, passes the prime-fd over `SCM_RIGHTS`, and the
compositor CPU-blits it into the scanout bo. GPU-tier + `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`
is the post-v1 GL milestone (F′, §7).

## §3. New ports required

Nothing Wayland-related is in `packages/registry/` today. Four new pieces:

| Port | Kind | Risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **libffi** (Wayland-scoped shim) | wasm32 static lib | **the one gating risk** | No wasm32 libffi exists upstream (only vendored copies inside cpython/spidermonkey). We do **not** port full libffi — see §4. **DONE (PR1).** |
| **wayland-scanner** | HOST build tool | low | Generates C glue from protocol XML. Provided via **`flake.nix`** (`pkgs.wayland-scanner` 1.24.0, darwin+linux clean — the split `-bin` derivation, NOT the Linux-only `wayland` lib), consumed via `[[host_tools]]`. **DONE (PR2).** |
| **wayland-protocols** | XML data (`kind = "source"`) | none | Protocol `.xml` **vendored in-tree** (`packages/registry/wayland-protocols/xml/`): `wayland.xml` 1.24.0 + `xdg-shell.xml` 1.45. Vendored because core `wayland.xml` ships only in the Linux-only `wayland` lib. **DONE (PR2).** |
| **libwayland** (client + server) | wasm32 static lib | medium | Depends on libffi + the AF_UNIX/SCM_RIGHTS/epoll surface above. **MUST pin wayland 1.24.0** to match the vendored `wayland.xml` and the host scanner. |

**PR2 result (2026-07-08).** The host toolchain is proven end-to-end:
`wayland-scanner` 1.24.0 (flake) generates client/server/private-code for
the full v1 interface set from the vendored XML, and the generated
private-code compiles cleanly for wasm32 against our sysroot (23
`wl_*_interface` symbols; core + xdg-shell). Gate:
`host/test/wayland-protocols-scanner.test.ts`. The one remaining
integration point — compiling the generated glue against libwayland's
`wayland-util.h` in the wasm sysroot — lands with PR3 (the scanner-side
compile was verified manually with the upstream 1.24.0 header).

Reusable across the port regardless of protocol (already scheduled by the
old plan's Phases A/B): real **libxkbcommon**, real **libinput**, KMS master,
EGL / `gbm_surface`, prime-fd + `SCM_RIGHTS`, the GL multiplexer.

**PR4 result (2026-07-08).** `libxkbcommon` 1.7.0 is ported to wasm32
(`packages/registry/libxkbcommon/`, `libxkbcommon.a`). Pinned to 1.7.0 —
the last release with a stable standalone dist tarball (newer releases are
GitHub-only auto-archives with less durable checksums); the TEXT_V1 keymap
format the port needs is version-stable. Built with the alsa-lib /
libwayland pattern (bypass meson; compile the core TUs against a
hand-curated `config.h`), with `bison` (flake.nix) generating the xkbcomp
parser. Gate: `host/test/libxkbcommon-smoke.test.ts` runs
`programs/xkb_smoke.c` — compiles a self-contained keymap with
`xkb_keymap_new_from_string` and translates keycodes+modifiers to
keysyms/UTF-8 (base `a`, Shift→`A`, EuroSign round-trip) under the kernel.

**PR5a result (2026-07-08).** `libevdev` 1.13.3 is ported to wasm32
(`packages/registry/libevdev/`, `libevdev.a` — two core TUs, uinput
skipped). It is the mandatory foundation of the real libinput port
(libinput's evdev backend is built entirely on `libevdev_new_from_fd` /
`libevdev_next_event`); the original PR5 one-liner had omitted it. Built
with the libxkbcommon pattern (bypass meson; hand-curated `config.h`),
with python3 (flake.nix) generating the event-name table from libevdev's
bundled full linux UAPI headers — the sysroot's `<linux/input-event-codes.h>`
is a deliberately minimal, ABI-locked subset (no `*_MAX` sentinels) that
libevdev's `*_MAX`-sized tables cannot compile against; a tiny
`<linux/types.h>` shim covers the one header the sysroot omits. Gate:
`host/test/libevdev-smoke.test.ts` runs `programs/libevdev_smoke.c` —
builds a libevdev from each virtual evdev node and decodes host-injected
key + pointer events (name lookups included) under the kernel.

Kernel gap fixed (additive, no ABI bump): `libevdev_set_fd` issues
`EVIOCGPHYS`/`EVIOCGUNIQ`/`EVIOCGPROP` and `EVIOCGKEY`/`EVIOCGLED`/`EVIOCGSW`
during construction and fatals on an unexpected errno; the kernel had
returned `ENOTTY` for all (tuned for SDL2, which tolerates it). Now
phys/uniq return `ENOENT` ("unset") and the state bitmaps return
zero-filled success — the honest state of a virtual device with nothing
latched. See `crates/kernel/src/syscalls.rs` `handle_input_ioctl` +
`shared::input` NR constants. Contrary to the initial PR5 assumption that
no kernel work was needed, libevdev was the first consumer to exercise
this surface.

**PR5b result (2026-07-08).** The two link/classification layers real
libinput builds on are in place:

- `mtdev` (`packages/registry/mtdev/`, `libmtdev.a`) — a link-only stub
  reproducing mtdev's public ABI. libinput references five `mtdev_*`
  symbols but calls them only for legacy protocol-A multitouch
  (`evdev_need_mtdev()` — has `ABS_MT_POSITION_X/Y` but no
  `ABS_MT_SLOT`). The kernel's virtual pointer reports plain
  `ABS_X/ABS_Y`, so that predicate is always false and the stub is never
  entered; each entry point aborts if it ever is. Gate:
  `host/test/mtdev-smoke.test.ts`.
- `libudev` (`packages/registry/libudev/`, `libudev.a`) — a PATH-mode
  shim whose load-bearing part reimplements udev's `input_id`
  classification (`test_pointers` + `test_key` + the EV_SW / scrollwheel
  fallbacks, faithful to systemd v255) over `EVIOCGBIT`/`EVIOCGPROP`
  probes, synthesizing the `ID_INPUT*` tags libinput's evdev core
  requires to accept a device. The other 13 udev entry points are thin
  no-ops. Gate: `host/test/libudev-input-id-smoke.test.ts` (event0 →
  `ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD`, event1 → `ID_INPUT_MOUSE` through the real API).

ABI bump to **v17** (the single deliberate bump this stack anticipated).
`WasmStat` grows 88→96 with a trailing `st_rdev`, and virtual evdev
nodes now stat as Linux char major 13, minor 64+N (`/dev/input/event0`
= 13:64). This is load-bearing for libinput's PATH backend, which drops
the devnode path and hands `udev_device_new_from_devnum` only the
`st_rdev` — the shim recovers the node by scanning `/dev/input/event*`
for the matching devnum. The v17 bump also folds in the DRI-branch ABI
changes accumulated since v16. Publishing v17 package binaries (php,
spidermonkey, wordpress, …) is the release-tag/matrix step; until then
those package tests fail against the v17 kernel by design.

**PR5c result (2026-07-09).** The real **libinput 1.25.0 core** is ported
(`packages/registry/libinput/`, `libinput.a`, 437 KB), replacing the
`libinput-lite` stub as the compositor's input library. Scope: the 35
path-backend TUs (`src_libfilter` + `src_libinput` core + util + quirks),
compiled directly against a hand-curated `config.h` + sed-substituted
version headers (upstream meson bypassed, same pattern as libxkbcommon /
libevdev). `src/udev-seat.c` is **dropped** — the udev enumerate/monitor
seat backend; the compositor drives the path backend only, and a symbol
audit confirmed no in-set TU references anything udev-seat.c defines. All
35 TUs compiled clean on the first pass: musl provides `static_assert`,
`versionsort`, and `newlocale`; the sysroot has `sys/epoll.h` +
`sys/timerfd.h`; the bundled full linux UAPI headers win over the
sysroot's minimal `<linux/input.h>` via `-Iinclude/linux` + a
`<linux/types.h>` shim (identical to the libevdev port). Links against
libevdev (PR5a) + the libudev + mtdev shims (PR5b).

Gate: `programs/libinput_smoke.c` +
`host/test/libinput-smoke.test.ts` — the first full-chain proof.
`libinput_path_add_device("/dev/input/event0")` runs the entire accept
path (stat → `st_rdev` recovery → `udev_device_new_from_devnum` →
`input_id` classification → `evdev_device_new` → libevdev capability
probe → device accepted, DEVICE_ADDED queued), then a host-injected
`EV_KEY` is read off the kernel evdev ring by libinput's epoll loop
(`sys_epoll_pwait` → `sys_poll` → the evdev ring-readiness gate) and
decoded into a `LIBINPUT_EVENT_KEYBOARD_KEY`.

**Dual-consumer decision:** SDL2 keeps depending on `libinput-lite`, not
the real port. SDL2 2.30 references **zero** libinput symbols (verified
by grep over the extracted source + configure) — it uses libinput purely
as an optional-detection stub — so pointing it at the 35-TU real library
would only bloat its dep graph and link surface for no functional gain.
The real `libinput` is a distinct consumer (this smoke + the PR6/PR7
compositor); its archive is linked from the resolver cache prefix by
full path, never through `$SYSROOT/lib/libinput.a` (which stays the lite
stub), so the two never collide. No ABI change (PR5c is additive:
package + program + test + docs only).

---

## §4. The libffi de-risk (crux of the whole pivot)

`libwayland`'s **only** use of libffi is `wl_closure_invoke` (and its dispatch
sibling): given a decoded message, it calls the target listener/implementation
function with the message's arguments. On **wasm32 every Wayland argument is a
single 32-bit word** — `int`, `uint`, `wl_fixed_t`, `new_id`, an object
pointer, a `char *` string, a `wl_array *`, or an `fd` `int`. Return type is
`void`. There are no doubles and no by-value structs anywhere in the Wayland
wire ABI.

So we do **not** port full libffi (with its per-arch assembly closures,
double/struct classification, and `ffi_closure` trampolines). We ship a
**Wayland-scoped shim**: `ffi_prep_cif` records only the argument count;
`ffi_call` reads that many `i32` words from the `avalue` array and dispatches
through a `switch` over arity `0..=WL_CLOSURE_MAX_ARGS+2`. Each `case` is a
function-pointer call of a distinct `(i32, …) -> ()` signature, which the LLVM
wasm backend lowers to `call_indirect` against the program's function table —
exactly the mechanism real libffi provides, minus everything Wayland never
exercises. ~200 LoC, no assembly.

`WL_CLOSURE_MAX_ARGS` is 20; `wl_closure_invoke` prepends `data` + `target`,
so the shim covers arities `0..=22`.

**Full libffi is deferred** to the GTK/glib tail (post-v1), where doubles,
by-value structs, and `ffi_closure` callbacks appear. That is a separate,
larger port and is explicitly out of scope here.

**PR1 (this branch) proves the shim before any libwayland investment**: a
native unit test constructs a cif and calls `ffi_call` across every arity
`0..=22` with a target that records its arguments, asserting each `i32` word
lands in the right parameter slot. Because function-pointer dispatch *is*
`call_indirect` on wasm32, proving the arity switch marshals arguments
correctly proves `wl_closure_invoke` will dispatch correctly. See
`packages/registry/libffi/` + `host/test/libffi-shim-unit.test.ts`.

**Open item (resolve in PR3/PR6, not a blocker):** confirm the shim covers
the *full* closure argument set actually emitted (fd / array / string args) —
these are all still single `i32` words, so the risk is low, but PR3 links the
shim against real `libwayland` and PR6 exercises it end-to-end.

## §5. Stacked-PR roadmap

Client and compositor land as a stack of small PRs. v1 target is milestone
**D′** (a Wayland client window rendered by our compositor, browser-gated).

| PR | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| **PR1** | **libffi Wayland-scoped shim** (`packages/registry/libffi/`) + trampoline proof. ← *this branch* |
| PR2 | `wayland-scanner` (host tool) + `wayland-protocols` (XML data) packages |
| PR3 | `libwayland` (client + server) wasm32 port, linked against the PR1 shim |
| PR4 | real `libxkbcommon` port (keymap translation; compositor + clients link it). **DONE.** |
| PR5 | real `libinput` port (gestures, palm rejection, multi-device). Lands as a bottom-up sub-stack — **PR5a `libevdev` (DONE)**, **PR5b `mtdev` stub + `libudev`/`input_id` shim (DONE)**, **PR5c `libinput` 1.25.0 core (DONE)** — since real libinput builds on all three (the original one-line scope omitted libevdev + mtdev). The real `libinput` serves the compositor; SDL2 keeps `libinput-lite` (it references no libinput symbols). |
| PR6 | `programs/wlcompositor/` — PID-2 server: core + `wl_shm` + `xdg_shell` + `wl_seat` + `wl_output`. **DONE.** Two-process smoke gate (`host/test/wlcompositor-smoke.test.ts`) drives a real client through connect → bind-all-globals → keymap fd-pass → xdg configure → shared-buffer composite (red pixel proof) → KMS flip → injected key+button delivery. Uncovered + fixed two kernel bugs: nested epoll readiness (epoll-on-epoll) and the `epoll_event` wasm32 layout (see §8.3). |
| **PR7** | `examples/libs/wpkdraw/` CPU rasterizer + `examples/libs/libkwl/` toolkit + `programs/wlterm/` (forkpty'd `dash` over a VT100 core) — **BROWSER GATE, milestone D′. DONE.** Node smoke gates (`host/test/{wpkdraw,libkwl,wlterm}-smoke.test.ts`) + browser gate (`apps/browser-demos/test/kandelo-wayland.spec.ts`, `/?demo=wayland`). Uncovered + fixed one kernel bug: PTY master `read()` dropped buffered output when the slave closed with the buffer non-empty (drain-before-EOF, behavioral only, no ABI bump); and replaced the compositor's minimal xkb keymap with a full US-QWERTY map so `wlterm` receives Return/printables. |
| PR8 | `wlfm` (file manager) + `xdg_popup` |
| PR9 | `wlpanel` + `wlbeep` |
| — | **Post-v1 GL (F′):** PR10 GPU-tier ioctls → PR11 `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` → PR12 sdl2 wayland backend → PR13 `wlcube` |

### v1 Wayland interface set

Implemented in v1: `wl_display`/`wl_registry`/`wl_callback`,
`wl_compositor`+`wl_surface`, `wl_shm`+`wl_shm_pool`+`wl_buffer`
(ARGB8888 / XRGB8888), `xdg_wm_base`+`xdg_surface`+`xdg_toplevel`,
`wl_seat`+`wl_keyboard`+`wl_pointer`, `wl_output`.

Deferred: `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` (post-v1 GL), `xdg_popup` (E′, PR8),
subsurface / server-side decoration / clipboard (post-v1). **Own apps use
client-side decoration (CSD).**

### Compositor design (PR6)

Run `libwayland`'s `wl_event_loop` on epoll. Register: the listen socket,
the `card0` DRM fd, and the libinput fd. **Socket path (PR6):** the compositor
binds `/tmp/wayland-0` (and writes its keymap to `/tmp/wlcompositor-keymap.xkb`),
not the plan's original `/run/wayland-0` — `/` is a read-only rootfs and
`/var/run` is `root:root 0755` (`EACCES` for a non-root uid), while `/tmp` is
`1777` world-writable. Recorded in a code comment in `wlcompositor.c`. A `wl_shm`
buffer is a client dumb-bo prime-fd received over `SCM_RIGHTS`. v1
compositing = CPU blit each committed surface into the `gbm_surface` scanout
bo + KMS `PAGE_FLIP`; gate on `gbm_surface_has_free_buffers`; pace clients via
`wl_surface.frame` callbacks. Input: handle **both** `POINTER_MOTION` and
`POINTER_MOTION_ABSOLUTE` (the browser emits `EV_ABS`). ESC is **forwarded**
to the focused client, **not** special-cased by the compositor.

---

## §6. Docs superseded / amended by this pivot

- **Supersede `2026-07-13-wpkcompositor-plan.md`** — the custom PID-2
  compositor, `libwpkclient`, and the 24-message custom wire are dropped.
  Replaced by PR3–PR9 above (real `libwayland` + `wlcompositor`).
- **Amend `2026-05-18-dri-design.md`:**
  - §9.2 (custom protocol) and §9.5 ("why custom protocol, not Wayland, in
    v1") — the reasoning is **reversed**. v1 *is* Wayland. Keep the sections
    as history but mark them superseded by this doc.
  - §15 (Wayland compat named + deferred) — **promote** Wayland from a
    deferred post-v1 compat layer to the v1 protocol.
- **Amend plans 8/10/11:**
  - Plan 8 (`wpkdraw`) — becomes a **CPU raster helper only** (rasterizer /
    blit utilities used by `libkwl`), not a compositor front-end.
  - Plan 10 — `libwpkclient` → **`libkwl`** (thin toolkit over
    `libwayland-client`).
  - Plan 11 — seed apps become **Wayland clients**; **drop the custom
    `SDL_wpkvideo` backend** in favor of SDL2's upstream Wayland backend
    (flip `--disable-video-wayland` → `--enable-video-wayland` in
    `packages/registry/sdl2/build-sdl2.sh` ~190–191, post-v1 in PR12).

---

## §7. Post-v1 milestones (named, out of scope for this doc)

- **F′ — GPU tier:** dispatch `DRM_IOCTL_WPK_CREATE_GPU_BO` /
  `WPK_BIND_FOREIGN_TEXTURE`; add `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`; SDL2 Wayland
  backend; `wlcube` GL client (PR10–PR13).
  **PARTIALLY LANDED (see §8.10):** `WPK_BIND_FOREIGN_TEXTURE` is
  implemented for CPU-tier bos and wlcompositor GPU-composites with it.
  Remaining: `WPK_CREATE_GPU_BO`, `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`, PR12/PR13.

### §7.1 Evaluation — GPU-rendering the CLIENTS (post-GPU-compositing)

Assessed 2026-07-13, after GPU compositing landed. Verdict: **do not
port the wpkdraw clients (wlclock/wlterm/wlpaint) to GL; finish the
GPU tier for apps that are already GL** (SDL2/`wlcube`, PR12–13).

Why not the wpkdraw clients:
- Their windows are small (340×360 … 960×540) and CPU rasterization
  with the new AA primitives is visually clean and cheap; a GL port
  buys no user-visible quality and adds a context per client.
- The compositing bottleneck they used to feed (full-desktop CPU blit
  + 8 MB presenter upload per frame) is already gone — texture
  re-uploads are per-commit and window-sized now.

What the real client-GL path needs (PR10–PR13 shape, refined by what
we learned):
1. **PR10 — `WPK_CREATE_GPU_BO`:** a GPU-tier bo backed by a
   `WebGLTexture` (no SAB, unmappable). Host-side the natural design
   is to back ALL renderD128 GL sessions with ONE real WebGL2 context
   multiplexed by `GlMuxer` (this is what it was built for —
   `switchTo` replays per-binding shadow state), because non-master
   clients have no display canvas to build a context on; each client
   renders into an FBO whose color attachment IS the GPU bo's texture.
   `WPK_BIND_FOREIGN_TEXTURE` on a GPU-tier bo then degenerates to
   "return the texture id" — zero copies, true zero-copy dmabuf
   semantics inside the shared context.
2. **EGL surface targeting:** clients need `eglCreateWindowSurface`
   (or a pbuffer) to target the bo-backed FBO instead of a canvas, and
   `eglSwapBuffers` must become the buffer-ready fence that precedes
   `wl_surface.commit`. Command order through the shared context (all
   sessions drain through one submit queue) gives render-before-sample
   ordering for free — no explicit sync object needed in v1.
3. **PR11 — `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`:** protocol-side, a thin addition
   now that the compositor's texture path exists — the dmabuf params'
   prime fd feeds the same `wpkEglImportDmabufHandle` +
   `wpkEglBindBoTexture` flow (GPU-tier bind = texture id lookup, no
   upload, no per-commit dirty re-upload needed).
4. **PR12/PR13:** flip SDL2 to `--enable-video-wayland` and add
   `wlcube` — the consumers that actually exercise the path.

Open risks carried to PR10: process exit must release GPU bos and
their FBOs across the shared context (the CPU-tier release path via
`gbm_bo_destroy` → `dropForeignTexturesForBo` is the template);
SwiftShader (headless CI) must be exercised early since every client
would now be GL; and the shared-context design assumes clients tolerate
`preserveDrawingBuffer`-style semantics on FBOs (they do — FBO content
persists by definition).
- **Full libffi:** doubles, by-value structs, `ffi_closure` — needed by
  glib/gobject.
- **Unmodified GTK/Qt apps:** the app-compat milestone; pulls in glib, cairo,
  pango, pixman, full libffi, plus `xdg_popup`, subsurface, clipboard, and
  server-side decoration.

## §8. Open verification items (resolve during PR3/PR6 — NOT blockers to start)

1. **EXERCISED (PR6).** Server-side access to a received prime-fd OFD. The
   compositor uses the `gbm_bo_import(GBM_BO_IMPORT_FD)` + `gbm_bo_map` path for
   `wl_shm` (not raw `mmap` of the fd — file/memfd `MAP_SHARED` is not shared
   cross-process; only the DRI BoRegistry is). This required carrying the
   prime-bo sidecar across `SCM_RIGHTS`: `InFlightFd` now holds an optional
   `prime_bo` (`pipe.rs`), `extract_scm_rights` captures it, and
   `install_scm_rights_fds` re-increments the bo refcount at install time
   (`wasm_api.rs`). The smoke gate proves it end-to-end via `COMPOSITE_SAMPLE
   px=0x00ff0000` (a client-painted red pixel composited in the server).
2. A DRM `event_ring` write wakes a parked `epoll_wait` on `card0` (else the
   1 ms host fallback covers liveness).
3. **EXERCISED (PR6).** libffi shim sufficiency for the full closure argument
   set. The compositor dispatches real fd / string / array closure args
   end-to-end (keymap fd over `wl_keyboard.keymap`, surface/toplevel requests,
   `wl_array` for keyboard state) through `wl_closure_invoke → ffi_call` with no
   shim gaps observed — see §4.

### Gaps discovered + fixed during PR3 (libwayland port)

The `wl_smoke` end-to-end test (one process hosting a libwayland server +
client over a kernel AF_UNIX socketpair) surfaced four kernel/host bugs that
libwayland is the first consumer to hit:

1. **`SO_PEERCRED`** was unimplemented. libwayland's `wl_client_create` calls
   it on every accepted client and refuses the client on error. Added
   `sys_getsockopt_peercred` (single-user model: returns the querying
   process's own pid/uid/gid). See `docs/posix-status.md`.
2. **`recvmsg`/`sendmsg` generic marshaling descriptors were wrong** — arg 2
   is `flags`, not a length, so the EAGAIN/error copyback in `completeChannel`
   copied kernel scratch over the caller's stack (corrupting a `wl_registry`
   pointer at bind time). Both handlers are hand-marshalled, so the descriptor
   was both wrong and unused for input; removed the two entries from
   `host_abi.rs`. Host-internal marshaling metadata only — not user-facing ABI.
3. **`epoll_event` layout** — on wasm32 the struct is *unpacked* (size 16,
   `data` at offset 8; musl only applies `__packed__` on x86_64); the kernel
   used a packed 12-byte / offset-4 layout. **This was documented as "fixed in
   `wasm_api.rs`" during PR3 but was actually incomplete**, and it was the true
   root cause of the PR6 wlcompositor input crash (see below). The authoritative
   epoll path for the running system is host-side — `handleEpollCtl` /
   `handleEpollPwait` in `host/src/kernel-worker.ts` — and it *also* carried the
   12/offset-4 layout, which the PR3 note missed. The bug is latent for
   single-event waits: at `i == 0` both the 12- and 16-byte strides start at
   offset 0 and the offset-4 read/write happen to cancel (the pointer lands in,
   and is read from, the high dword), so socket-driven `wl_event_loop` dispatch
   worked all the way to `CLIENT_READY`. It only bites at `i >= 1`, where the
   12-vs-16 stride desyncs and a second ready fd's `data` reads back as **0** →
   a NULL `struct libinput_source *` in libinput's `libinput_dispatch` loop
   (`source->dispatch(source->user_data)` traps with a `call_indirect` null /
   signature mismatch). libinput registers three fds in its own epoll (timer +
   two evdev nodes), so injected input is the first workload to make two fire at
   once. **Fixed for real in PR6**, consistently across all four marshalling
   sites: `wasm_api.rs` `kernel_epoll_ctl`/`kernel_epoll_pwait` and
   `kernel-worker.ts` `handleEpollCtl`/`handleEpollPwait` (16-byte stride, data
   at offset 8, full 16-byte scratch copy). Regression-covered by a kernel unit
   test (`test_epoll_pwait_multiple_events_data`) and the PR6 smoke gate.
4. **epoll_pwait finite-timeout hang** — the host converts epoll_pwait to a
   non-blocking poll and retries on a timer, but never honored the timeout:
   a drained fd set (the `[PARK]` case) retried forever. Added a per-channel
   deadline (`epollWaitDeadlines`) that persists across wakeup-driven retries
   so the wait returns 0 after ~timeout instead of resetting on every poke.

### Gaps discovered + fixed during the desktop demo hardening (post-PR7)

Running the full three-client desktop (`/?demo=wayland`) as a real user —
typing, dragging windows, drag-painting, leaving it idle — surfaced the ten
findings below (most of them real defects) that no marker-based gate caught.
All are addressed on this branch; the first four live in shared kernel/host
code, so both hosts get them.

1. **Blocking-poll timeouts never expired** (`host/src/kernel-worker.ts`).
   The EAGAIN retry loop re-entered `handleBlockingRetry` / `handleSelect` /
   `handlePselect6` from scratch on every broad wake and recomputed
   `deadline = now + timeout` each time, so a finite `poll` timeout on a
   quiet fd set never fired while the system was busy — wlclock (paced by
   `poll(fds, 1, 40)`) ran at ~0.5 fps and stopped entirely at idle. Fixed
   with `blockingWaitDeadlines`, a per-`retryKey` deadline map that persists
   the first-block deadline across retries (the same pattern
   `epollWaitDeadlines` already used; see §8.4).
2. **`munmap` leaked the rounding tail** (`crates/kernel/src/memory.rs`).
   `mmap` rounds the mapping length up to the 64 KB wasm page but `munmap`
   freed only the literal length, stranding an unusable tail remnant per
   cycle. The compositor maps/unmaps its scanout bo every frame
   (`gbm_bo_map`/`unmap`), so ~8.3 MB of address space leaked per flip →
   ENOMEM and a silent permanent freeze at ~124 frames. `munmap` now rounds
   up to the page (Linux semantics); two unit tests cover it.
3. **`PAGE_FLIP` never latched the host scanout fb**
   (`crates/kernel/src/syscalls.rs`). Only `SETCRTC` called
   `host.kms_set_fb`, so the host-side blit pump scanned out the first bo
   forever — the compositor's *back* buffer every other frame — and the
   60 Hz pump caught frames mid-composite: the desktop flickered randomly
   with windows missing. `PAGE_FLIP` now latches the new fb at ioctl time
   (the fb is fully painted before the flip, and the client only reuses the
   old bo after the flip-complete event, so the latch is race-free).
   Covered by a kernel unit test (`kms_page_flip_latches_host_scanout_fb`)
   and a browser flicker gate (canvas PNG-size distribution, verified to
   fail on the pre-fix kernel).
4. **2D KMS blit rendered R↔B swapped** (`kernel-worker.ts` vblank pump).
   DRM XRGB8888 is little-endian `0xXXRRGGBB` (bytes B,G,R,X) while
   `ImageData` wants R,G,B,A; the blit now swizzles in place. Only affects
   `mode: "2d"` consumers — the CPU-rendered compositor path. (Superseded
   for the wayland demo by item 8: the pane now uses `mode:
   "webgl2-scanout"` and the swizzle happens in the fragment shader; the
   CPU swizzle remains correct for legacy `"2d"` consumers. GL demos keep
   the WebGL2 bridge and the pump never touches their canvas.)
5. **Software cursor removed** (`wlcompositor.c`). The browser shows the
   host pointer and the input bridge maps it absolutely (EV_REL
   peg-and-jump emulation into `event1` — not the EV_ABS path §5 originally
   assumed), so the compositor's sprite sat exactly under it as a double
   cursor. Bare pointer motion no longer schedules a repaint.
6. **Move-grabbed windows teleported to the top-left corner during drags**
   (`wlcompositor.c`). The peg-and-jump emulation sends each pointer move
   as TWO motion events (peg to (0,0), then jump to the target), and the
   compositor repainted synchronously per event — so every drag update
   rendered one frame with the grabbed window at the top-left. Two fixes:
   repaints are now deferred until the libinput drain loop finishes
   (`in_input_batch`, one repaint per input batch at the final cursor
   position), and a peg event (REL ≤ −2048 on both axes — impossible from
   a real device) updates the cursor without delivering motion, so even a
   batch split between peg and jump can't render or leak the pegged
   position to clients. Gate: the browser drag gate samples the desktop's
   top-left corner per drag step and requires pixel-stability.
7. **The desktop rendered stretched** (`Modeset.tsx`). The pane's canvas
   used `width:100%; height:auto; max-height:100%`, which distorts a 16:9
   framebuffer in a wider pane — every 1-px glyph/line smeared
   non-uniformly and the demo read as "pixelated". The canvas now renders
   with `object-fit: contain` (letterboxed, aspect-true) and the pointer
   mapping + the spec's `desktopPoint` helper map through the fitted
   content box.
8. **Wayland demo flipped from the 2D blit to a WebGL2 scanout presenter**
   (`kernel-worker.ts` + both host protocols + `kernel-host.ts` +
   `Modeset.tsx`). New pump mode `"webgl2-scanout"` (the §7 F′ GPU path
   remains the roadmap; this is option (a) — present the CPU-composited
   scanout through GL): the pump owns a WebGL2 context on the CRTC canvas
   and draws the scanout as a texture — fragment-shader XRGB→RGB swizzle,
   GL letterbox, trilinear-over-mipmap GPU scaling at the pane's
   device-pixel resolution (a main-thread ResizeObserver feeds
   `kms_set_display_size`, dual-host message). Presents are change-driven:
   kernel commit count + a ~15 Hz strided-checksum content probe. The
   probe is load-bearing for gate 5's detection power — flip-synced
   presents alone sample a latch-pinned bo *before* its repaint and hide
   the PAGE_FLIP-latch regression (negative control re-verified: latch
   removed → 2/120 flicker dropouts, median 19.2 KB; fixed → 0/120).
   Software-GL hosts (headless Chromium) auto-degrade to bilinear when a
   steady-state present exceeds the 16 ms frame budget. Two gotchas
   captured in code comments: WebGL refuses SAB-backed views (the scanout
   copy stays), and Chrome reflects the committed OffscreenCanvas bitmap
   size back into the placeholder's `width`/`height` attributes, so the
   pane's pointer math now maps through kernel-reported scanout dims
   (stats slots 2/3) instead of `canvas.width`. Stats slot 7 reports the
   active presenter and the Modeset chip + spec gate 1c assert `webgl2`.
9. **The desktop letterboxed instead of filling the pane** (user report:
   "we don't use the whole width of the canvas"). The connector's
   preferred mode is now derived from the embedder-reported display size
   (`buildVirtualConnectorMode`: `round(1080 × aspect) × 1080`, width
   clamped [1440, 3840], even-aligned; 1920×1080 fallback for Node /
   headless). The wayland boot flow feeds the pane's device-pixel size
   to the kernel BEFORE spawning wlcompositor (`live-setup.ts` waits up
   to 1.5 s for the pane's ResizeObserver, measuring the canvas directly
   as a fallback), and wlcompositor's placement rules became
   edge-anchored (negative x = offset from the right edge; resolved
   coordinates are byte-identical to the old fixed layout at 1920). The
   wayland spec parses the live mode from the Modeset chip
   (`readDesktopDims`) and derives all window geometry from it. The
   mode is fixed at boot; post-boot pane resizes letterbox rather than
   re-mode (dynamic mode switching = future work).

New permanent gates from this pass: `host/test/wldesktop-liveness-smoke.test.ts`
(node: PAGE_FLIP commits keep advancing across drag-paint strokes) and
`kandelo-wayland.spec.ts` gates 1c (webgl2 renderer active), 1d (the
compositor composites on the GPU — WLC_RENDERER gpu), 3 (per-step
corner stability during the window drag), 4 (drag-paint liveness), and 5
(flicker stability).

10. **GPU compositing landed in wlcompositor (first slice of §7 F′).**
   `DRM_IOCTL_WPK_BIND_FOREIGN_TEXTURE` is now dispatched for CPU-tier
   bos: the kernel resolves the caller's fd-local handle to the global
   bo id and the host (re)uploads the bo's SAB pixels into a
   `WebGLTexture` in the caller's context (`host/src/webgl/
   foreign-texture.ts`; texture id stable per bo, lifetime tied to the
   bo, `UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH` honors the bo stride, creator's live mmap is
   flushed to the SAB first). libEGL exposes the flow as
   `wpkEglImportDmabufHandle` / `wpkEglBindBoTexture` /
   `wpkEglCloseBoHandle` (a stand-in for EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import),
   plus `EGL_WIDTH`/`EGL_HEIGHT` window-surface attribs so a compositor
   can size the drawing buffer before its first ADDFB. wlcompositor
   probes GL at boot by compiling its quad shader (sync queries fail
   cleanly headless → CPU path; `WLC_NO_GPU=1` forces it; one-shot
   `WLC_RENDERER gpu|cpu` marker, asserted by spec gate 1d) and renders
   wallpaper texture + z-ordered window quads + focus border in ONE
   cmdbuf flush per frame (atomic canvas transition — gate 5 stays
   meaningful), with per-commit dirty tracking so only changed buffers
   re-upload. Canvas ownership: the compositor's context claims the CRTC
   canvas (`markKmsCanvasGlOwned` now fires only after `getContext`
   succeeds, disposes the pump's webgl2-scanout presenter, and sets
   stats slot 7 = 3 → chip `webgl2-gl`); a runtime GL failure terminates
   EGL, which fires the new `markKmsCanvasGlReleased` and the pump
   presenter resumes in its pre-claim mode, so degrade never freezes the
   canvas. PAGE_FLIPs continue as the frame clock either way, and the
   one-shot COMPOSITE_SAMPLE comes from a 1×1 `glReadPixels` on the GL
   path (context created with `preserveDrawingBuffer` so the cross-task
   readback survives the browser's present).
