# Rust-first ABI-44 campaign — MASTER PLAN

**This is the single authoritative plan.** It supersedes the documents listed
in "Superseded" below, which are deleted in the same change that adds this one.
If this file and another disagree, this file is wrong or the other is stale —
resolve it here, do not fork the plan again.

## Why this exists

The campaign accumulated 132 plan documents, 21 of them about fork alone. Three
of those defined the fork end state precisely and were not read before work was
dispatched against it; a census was commissioned that re-derived one of their
sections. That is not a worker failure. It is what happens when the plan is
distributed across a hundred files and briefs are written from memory.

The maintainer's instruction, verbatim: *"We need to deeply characterize and
plan each lane, not leave it up to worker judgment. We keep getting into
messes and off track."*

So the rule for this file is:

> **A lane is not dispatchable until its section here states the end state, the
> floor, the increments, the acceptance evidence, and the known hazards.**
> "Investigate and report" is characterization work, not a lane, and its output
> belongs in this file before anyone builds from it.

## The four goals, in the maintainer's framing

1. **V1** — share code across hosts.
2. **V2** — deeper Rust type checking.
3. **V3** — bundle the kernel with the VFS so an ABI change cannot break images.
4. **V4 — minimize the host API surface so a new host is cheap to write.**
   *This is the primary goal.* Every lane is measured against it first.

**The V4 measure is a number nobody has stated and everyone should:** how many
functions must a new host implement to run Kandelo? Today the kernel floor is
**72 host functions plus `env.memory`** (a raw import-*entry* count reads 73 —
that trap has caught four agents; say which you counted). The fork module's own
import object is **9 entries, exactly one function** (`resolve_externref`).

## What "done" means for PR #1350

Not "every lane finished". #1350 ships when:

- every lane below is either **landed**, or **explicitly deferred in this file
  with its handoff written**;
- no lane has landed a mechanism with no production caller (see Hazard H-1);
- the host suite's failures are each attributed to a named cause;
- conformance has no campaign-caused regression, stated with evidence.

## Standing hazards — these are not lane-specific

- **H-1 — a dead floor reads as complete.** Rust that has never executed, with
  green tests and careful doc comments, is *harder* to remove than an
  undocumented orphan: the docs and tests are what make it look finished. Six
  found this week. **Every lane's acceptance evidence must include a caller
  census for anything it adds.**
- **H-2 — a guard that cannot fail is not a guard.** Mutate every new guard
  until it fails and report what it said. One was found *silently skipped*
  because its anchor matched three places, which reads identically to being
  killed.
- **H-3 — native tests cannot see wasm-only breakage.** Three defects landed
  this week that `cargo test` could not observe: a `cfg`-gated deletion, a
  tree-shaken side-effect import, and a kernel trap whose native twin passes.
  Build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` in the loop, not at the end.
- **H-4 — read the first line of a failure, never the tally.** Twice in one day
  a tally matched the hypothesis under investigation and was something else.
- **H-5 — a check that answers a different question.** `git branch -r
  --contains` on a pre-cherry-pick SHA can only answer "no". Compare content or
  subjects, not identifiers.
- **H-6 — repetition is a power calculation, not a quantity.** Twelve runs
  cannot distinguish a 0% failure rate from 5%. State the rate your sample
  excludes, or your "N repetitions" is a ritual.
- **H-7 — measure on a quiet machine and say the load.** One performance number
  has already been withdrawn; a real 3.5 µs regression read as zero for a day.

# LANE F — fork control flow: invert it, do not port it

**Status: characterized, dispatchable. The largest lane by line count and the
one the campaign most lost track of.**

## End state

The fork module drives each sub-sequence itself. The host calls **3–5 coarse
entries** — `fm_parent_seal_capture`, `fm_parent_replay`,
`fm_child_reconstruct`, `fm_abort` (the middle two may collapse into one
dispatched entry, giving 3) — and does nothing between them except the floor
below. **0–1 new host imports.**

Today there are **95 `fm_*` entry points**, several of them per-type variants
(`fm_capture_intern_externref` / `fm_capture_intern_funcref`,
`fm_externref_handle` / `fm_funcref_ordinal`). A prior document records a
**reached floor of 71**. Reconciling 71 against 95 is the first task of this
lane: either the surface regrew by 24 or the two counts measure different
things, and if it regrew that is the same species of finding as the TypeScript
growth below.

## Why porting made it worse, measured

Fork TypeScript across the campaign: **23,246 → 26,113 lines** in the dedicated
files, plus **6,083 → 7,536** in `worker-main.ts`. Against a contract that says
this "shrinks toward the floor over time; it does not grow."

The mechanism is not carelessness. **Every fine-grained `fm_*` call leaves a
host-side seeding and base-arithmetic loop behind by construction.** One commit
that "moved the gate into `fm_attach_child`" was **+73/−69 in `worker-main.ts`
— net +4**. Porting a function moves an algorithm and leaves its driver.
Inversion removes the driver. **This is why the lane is inversion and not
migration, and it is the single most important sentence in this section.**

One correction to the growth figure: `process-lifecycle.ts` is **not** part of
it. It did not exist at the merge-base; it was created by de-duplicating the two
kernel-worker entries, which fell 8,477 → 3,206. Across those three files the
campaign is **−454**.

## The floor — what must not move, with the reason it cannot

Taken from `2026-09-08-fork-controlflow-inversion-scope.md` §2, which derived
each from a Wasm capability limit rather than from convention:

| Floor item | Why it cannot move into the module |
|---|---|
| Child worker spawn + COW instantiate | No Wasm capability creates a Worker or an instance, **and the fork spans two workers** — the child reconstruct runs in a different instance, so no single module call can span parent and child. |
| The real `fork()`/`vfork()` syscall + channel | Process-creation authority over the shared channel; the child worker is spawned by the host in response. |
| Guest top-level entry + fork-unwind catch + phase re-enter loop | The entry can end via a **tagged `WebAssembly.Exception`** *or* a `kernel_exit` **`unreachable` trap**, and the two must be discriminated. Wasm-EH `catch` catches the tagged throw but **cannot catch the trap**. Only the JS boundary sees a `RuntimeError`. |
| `resolve_externref(handle) -> externref` | A Wasm module cannot hold a live `externref` in Rust or mint one from a handle. The proven floor seam. |
| Anyref-transit `Table.grow` sizing | Rust/LLVM does not emit `table.grow` for the host-owned transit table; the host must grow before the drive. |
| PIC placement globals | Host-chosen at instantiation; the module cannot place itself. |
| Ref-typed catalogs and the resume table | Host-built from live funcref/anyref values; the module only ever sees resolved i32/i64 coordinates. |
| Node/browser worker-message bridge | Host transport. |

**Candidate ninth item, not yet in the contract:** Wasm has no funcref equality
instruction, so `ForkFunctionCatalog.encode` may be as irreducible as
`resolve_externref`. **Decide this explicitly** — if it is floor, add it to
`CLAUDE.md`'s floor list, because an unnamed floor item is one a future agent
must re-derive, and re-derivation is how this lane regrew.

## Increments

- **F0 — delete what has no caller. ~4,400 lines, free.** `fork-reference-recipes.ts`
  (1,316 lines of which *two type declarations* are live), a 555-line dead
  encoder in `fork-reference-segments.ts`, a 270-line data feed in
  `fork-early-reference-provider.ts` made unreachable by the `fm_ref_*` import
  flip, and — maintainer-authorised — the generic owner-import registration path
  (~170) plus the ~850-line typed-signature mailbox layer that exists only to
  serve it. **No dependencies. Start here.**
- **F1 — reconcile 71 vs 95** and publish the categorized surface. Blocks F2.
- **F2 — collapse per-type `fm_*` variants** into kind-discriminated entries,
  the same move that took `host_blob_read` + `host_fetch_archive` to one
  `host_fetch_deferred`. Not in the same change as F0.
- **F3 — the four coarse entries**, in the order §3 gives: `fm_abort` first
  (it is the precondition for the others), then `fm_child_reconstruct`, then
  the parent pair.
- **F4 — delete the host-side drivers each coarse entry replaces.** *A coarse
  entry that does not delete its driver has not landed.*

## Acceptance evidence

- **Per commit: the production TypeScript delta.** A migration commit that is
  net-positive in TypeScript needs an explicit justification in its body or it
  is not finished. This is the lane's headline number.
- Host import count measured **from the built artifact**, expected unchanged at
  72 + `env.memory` — this lane is import-neutral, and anyone claiming
  otherwise should measure.
- For F0: a transitive caller census per deletion. A direct grep produced 13
  false alarms in one afternoon because most call sites reach their target
  indirectly.
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build in the loop (H-3).

## Known hazards

- **The `ABORT_UNWINDING` discipline.** `fm_parent_seal_capture` must not drive
  the guest's `wpk_fork_unwind_end` when a reserve failed mid-unwind — it
  corrupts the state machine. **Two naive attempts trapped or hung.** Inherit
  the discipline; do not rediscover it.
- **Two resume-slot numberings run concurrently.** `replay_journal.rs:15` says
  "validated-but-unused. TypeScript still drives every fork" — **stale**. The
  module uses `ReplayEventJournal` and `ResumeSlotTable` while the JS
  `ForkResumeTable` is live, and divergence means `call_indirect` reaches the
  wrong thunk: **silent corruption, not a loud error.** Verify, then either
  finish the cutover or guard the two numberings.
- `module_state_records.rs` is **483 dead Rust lines whose live twin is 3,860
  TypeScript lines**. The fork TS growing and the fork Rust never running are
  plausibly one phenomenon.

# LANE V — the VFS image, and the filesystem we implement twice

**Status: partly characterized. V1–V3 landed; V4 blocked on a decision made;
V5 designed and building. The 12,000-line finding below is NOT yet
characterized and must not be dispatched until it is.**

## End state

The kernel writes the image body. The host supplies only what it has authority
over — which, after V5, is nothing inside the body at all. `entries[]` and the
lazy JSON sections are gone. **One implementation of SFFS, in Rust.**

## What has landed

- **V1** — the kernel serves image-backed bytes from the image. Import floor
  75 → 74 on its own; composed to 73 with an independent deletion.
- **V2** — a Rust SFFS writer, 2,103 lines, pinned to the TypeScript one by
  four byte-level cross-language fixtures.
- **V3** — streamed emission. `export_image_read(offset, out, source)` is
  offset-addressable and never buffers content; a 2 MiB deferred file
  materialises exactly two blocks.
- **V5 (in progress)** — deferred-file metadata moves **into the body** as an
  SDEF section addressed by a hidden inode, named from one superblock `u32`,
  costing zero bytes when absent. Parser is total, bounded and canonical.

## Why V5 exists and why xattrs lost

The maintainer asked why the metadata lived in JSON rather than the filesystem
format. The answer dissolved a boundary this plan had overstated: `klzy.rs`
governs **who decides** a URL may be fetched, not **who stores** the string, and
the format already stores symlink targets without that conferring authority over
what they resolve to.

**Extended attributes were disqualified, not merely costed:** they are
guest-visible by definition, so a guest could `setxattr` the URL its own files
are fetched from — an authority leak *created by the storage choice*. With
`sudo` and `sudo-lite` shipping setuid-root (below), that is not theoretical.
No follow-up item: if something calls for xattrs later it gets considered fresh.

## The finding that is not yet a lane

**SFFS exists twice.** `sffs_write.rs`'s own doc says it "reproduce[s]
`host/src/vfs/sharedfs-vendor.ts`" — same superblock geometry, same allocators,
same magic. **The TypeScript half is 12,198 lines. V4's stated deliverable
deletes 318 of them.** The Rust writer is already live via
`kernel_rootfs_export_tree`, and nothing in any register names the other
11,880.

**This must be characterized before it is dispatched** — end state, floor,
increments, acceptance — exactly as this file requires. It is plausibly larger
than the fork lane.

## Known hazards

- **V4 would silently destroy every lazy file** if routed through
  `export_image_read` without the identity contract: 65 files in the base
  image, 79 in a derived one, each surviving as a zero-byte regular file with
  no URL. Measured, not reasoned — both images were built.
- **The existing `KLZY`-versus-JSON gate cannot catch it**, because it compares
  the image's two *descriptions* of itself against each other; both can agree
  perfectly and both disagree with the body. Under V5 that gate becomes
  **unrepresentable by construction**, which is the best possible outcome for it
  and must be recorded as retirement rather than removal.
- **Build the gate before the contract.** A gate written after the thing it
  checks gets shaped to pass; one of this lane's own tests demonstrated that
  within a single commit by perturbing two axes at once.
- **Fixture regeneration can silently lose coverage.** `sffs-slots` and
  `sffs-tail` exist to reach two paths that mutation proved were entirely dead,
  and they reach them by construction. Any change that moves bytes must re-run
  the full mutation campaign and report which fixture kills which mutation —
  not "the fixtures still pass".

# LANE S — setuid lazy references are fetched without integrity

**Status: characterized, small, dispatchable. Security-relevant.**

## The defect, fully verified

`images/rootfs/PACKAGES.toml` sets `default_install = "lazy"`. Three packages
are `mode = "4755", uid = 0` — setuid root. `login` opts out with
`install = "eager"`; **`sudo` and `sudo-lite` do not.**
`scripts/generate-rootfs-package-manifest.mjs` resolves install as
`pkg.install ?? defaultInstall ?? config.default_install ?? "lazy"` and its lazy
branch emits `<path> f <mode> <uid> <gid> lazy_url=… lazy_size=…` — **mode
preserved, URL and size the only attributes, no digest anywhere.**

`LazyFileEntry` carries no integrity field. The lazy *archive* types do.

So two setuid-root binaries are fetched at runtime by URL with **length as the
only check**. Bytes of the same length from a substituting host, a poisoned
cache or a network position execute as root inside the guest. HTTPS is
transport security, not artifact integrity, and a third-party host is under no
obligation to use it.

## End state

Deferred bytes are verified against a digest recorded with the reference, and
the setuid bit is not honoured on unverified bytes.

## Increments

- **S1 — host-side digest, cheap.** `createHash` is already imported in the
  emitter, and **`assertLazyIntegrity(data, kind, integrity)` already exists**
  and is called in three places for archives and trees. Emit the digest, carry
  it, call the existing verifier. **Belongs in lane V's SDEF record, not in
  JSON we are about to delete.**
- **S2 — kernel-side verification.** The kernel verifies the bytes it is handed,
  which makes a substituting *host* detectable rather than trusted. Needs a
  sha256 in the kernel; lands with V5, where the kernel parses the record
  anyway.

**Forbidding setuid + deferred is not available** — production depends on the
combination.

# LANE M — shared-mapping cutover: DEFERRED

**Status: deferred by the maintainer, handoff written, dead floor removed.**

Not cancelled. If more of it is wanted in #1350, it arrives as a **separate PR
targeting #1350's branch**, landing there before #1350 merges.

The full handoff is `docs/plans/2026-09-11-lane-a-state-of-the-lane.md` and is
**not** superseded by this file — it is the lane's characterization, written by
the agent that did the diagnosis, and a future owner should read it whole.

**What shipped and stays:** handle retention and its three consult sites, the
`statx` two-bug fix with a round-trip guard over `u64::MAX`, `file_identity_key`
with the aligned `ino == 0` refusal, the live-process seeding fix, and the
`unlinkat` regression fix with its transitive census of all 40 path-taking
syscalls.

**What was removed on deferral, and why it matters:** `track_file_mapping`,
`track_fd_writeback_mapping` and `backing_key_for_fd_facts` — 368 lines with no
caller. They were well-tested and carefully documented, **which is what made
them dangerous rather than harmless** (H-1). Shipping them would have added a
dead floor in the lane opened to delete dead floors.

**The item is ~15% done, not half.** `shared_mapping_policy.rs` is 1,108 lines
with zero production callers; `SharedMappingResolver`'s only impl is its own
test double; the per-syscall range policy was never ported. Anyone resuming
should take the handoff's A1–A5 decomposition and its **nine** coverage gaps,
resolver/identity agreement first.

**Two findings to carry:** the writable-upgrade path of
`get_or_create_file_backing` was reached by **zero of 2,037 tests** — a
`panic!` at its head failed nothing — and the host and kernel device-number
spaces are disjoint **by accident of two independently chosen constants**,
neither documenting the other, with ~1.93 billion pairs of margin.

---

# LANE X — process and exec

**Status: partly characterized. B10's direction is settled; its blocker is not.**

## Where shebang belongs — settled

`#!` is a **kernel** feature on Linux, the BSDs and macOS: `execve(2)` itself
substitutes the interpreter. **POSIX does not specify `#!` at all**; what it
requires is that the libc `execlp`/`execvp` family fall back to `sh` when
`execve` returns `[ENOEXEC]`.

So a libc-only implementation is not a simplification, it is a divergence:
`#!` scripts would fail under direct `execve` and work only through a shell or
a `p`-variant. `make`, `dinit` and anything using `posix_spawn` would break.
**The kernel is the right home.**

## What landed, and what reverted

Landed and staying: the directory-exec errno fix (`EISDIR` → `EACCES` on the
exec path only, `open(2)` untouched), and the correction of a test that pinned
`MockHostIO`'s behaviour rather than production's — it asserted `EACCES` only
because the mock opens directories successfully.

Reverted: the preflight repoint. `kernel_exec_target_probe` **traps** —
`RuntimeError: unreachable`, a Rust panic under `panic=immediate-abort` — in
`resolve_shebang`'s header read for an overlay-backed target, a path that had
**never executed in the TypeScript kernel**; only `crates/host-native` called
it. The probe, its export, its ABI entry and six tests remain in place but
inert, so the repoint is a one-commit reapply once the panic is understood.

`parseShebang` is therefore back and **B10's deletion is not banked.**

## Increments

- **X1 — find the panic.** Needs a kernel built *without*
  `panic=immediate-abort` to get a message. The bisect is already precise: a
  sentinel before the `probe` call clears the fault, after it reproduces.
- **X2 — reapply the repoint** and bank the deletion.
- **X3 — decide the nested-`#!` limit.** Kandelo allows one level; Linux allows
  ~4 then `ELOOP`; POSIX is silent. Currently documented as a visible gap in
  `docs/posix-status.md`, which is contract-compliant. Raising it is platform
  scope with no reported need.

## Known hazards

- **The native harness is structurally blind here.**
  `probe_resolves_an_overlay_target_without_trapping` covers exactly the failing
  shape **and passes natively**, because `MockHostIO` has no blob/image byte
  source. Any fix must be validated on wasm (H-3).
- Three spawn test files fail with `kernel_exec_target_artifact_policy failed`
  and are **unrelated** to this lane — verified by reverting and observing
  identical counts. They are unattributed work and belong to whoever takes
  lane X or a successor.

---

# LANE C — conformance

**Status: characterized, near done.**

## Where it stands

**51 failures → 8, and none of the 8 are platform defects.** Two dispatch-table
bugs accounted for 42 of them, both **pre-existing** and both invisible until
the suite could execute a guest at all:

- `setsockopt` took the sixth channel word — always 0 for a five-argument
  syscall — as the process pointer width, which the guard rejects unless it is
  4 or 8. Every `SOL_SOCKET` set failed `EINVAL` before the fd was read.
- `ioctl` had the identical defect. It read as a *networking* fault because
  requests absent from the contract table skip the guard and correctly answer
  `ENOTTY`, so only requests with handlers failed — and `net_if` enumerates
  through `SIOCGIFCONF`.

**K6 is exonerated**: both arms are byte-identical at the merge-base.

## The remaining 8

All harness collateral: `BUILTINS=explicit` gives the guest no `/bin/sh` and no
`gencat`, so `popen`, `pclose`, `system`, `wordexp`, `wordfree` and three
`nl_types` cases cannot run. That flag is what took the suite from 1,352
timeouts to 5. **An explicit minimal program set — `sh` and `gencat` — would
likely recover all eight** without reintroducing per-test closure resolution.
Untried; it is a runner-contract decision.

## Increments

- **C1 — the minimal builtin set**, recovering the 8.
- **C2 — B14 follow-through.** Two genuine pre-existing gaps are XFAIL'd with
  the boundary named: two `shmat` in one process do not alias, and a blocking
  `msgrcv` is never woken by a later `msgsnd` (3/3 deterministic, while a
  blocking `semop` *is* woken).

## Acceptance evidence

The campaign's conformance-neutrality claim needs the failing **file sets**
compared, not the totals. Note the merge-base cannot produce a comparable set —
its runner lacks `KANDELO_RUNNER_BUILTINS=explicit`, so every guest-executing
test times out and FAIL reads 0 because nothing ran. Mechanism attribution plus
repetition is the substitute, and it is what produced the numbers above.

---

# LANE B — build and provisioning truthfulness

**Status: partly landed, remainder characterized and dispatched.**

## Landed

- **B29** — a stale kernel now says it is stale. `host-native` failures used to
  read `failed to find function export …`, naming the symptom and hiding the
  cause; the artifact's provenance — path, tier, which other tiers shadow it,
  declared ABI, both freshness stamps — is now attached to bring-up failures.
  It caught its own coordinator within hours.
- **B30** — a build killed mid-flight no longer publishes an authority for a
  build that never finished. Retract-first/publish-last, because nothing
  in-process runs on `SIGKILL`. Demonstrated with real kills in both
  directions; recovery republishes from receipts rather than rebuilding.
- **The installer tells the truth** rather than stamping: a hand-staged kernel
  says it cannot be freshness-checked. Stamping there would let a stale
  artifact, a debug build or another worktree's copy acquire a claim of engine
  provenance — *turning "cannot be verified" into "claims to have been
  verified" is the same defect pointed the other way, and worse because it is
  silent.*

## In flight

- **Source fallbacks.** `[source] url` is a single `String`; `m4` points at
  `ftpmirror.gnu.org`, a redirector, and when its target is down the build fails
  eight retries deep on the same dead host — cascading through `coreutils-docs`
  to every image product. **The sha256 is already pinned, which is what makes
  fallbacks safe**: integrity does not depend on which host answered.
- **B37 — DISPROVED, and the correction matters more than the item.** I filed
  this as "the SDK build mutates an input of its own cache key" on the strength
  of one failure message. It **did not reproduce**: a full `local-build` ran
  98/98 nodes, Products 7/7, exit 0, with zero "cache key changed". A
  before/after snapshot of every declared kandelo-sdk input *and* every global
  toolchain input came back empty — not one moved. `npm` does run in the tree,
  but nothing it writes is a cache-key input of that package.

  What landed instead is the part that was real: the refusal printed two opaque
  shas and now names the inputs that moved. Same shape as B29 and B30 — the
  state was correct and the explanation was missing.

## Known hazards

**RETRACTED — the `libc/musl` cache-key defect does not exist.** This file
recorded it as measured fact and the maintainer decided on it. Both were wrong.
`hash_global_package_build_input` already special-cases `libc/musl` to
`hash_gitlink_input`, which reads the gitlink object id from the git index and
hashes only that — deliberately, since PR #619, with the reasoning written in
the code. The "three digests" measurement was a probe hashing the directory,
never what xtask computes: a property of the directory reported as a property
of the cache key. A counterfactual settles it — adding and removing object
files under `libc/musl` does not move a package key, and does not move it even
when the walk is forced. **A census of every other global toolchain input found
no entry with the defect shape**: `libc/musl` is the only tree that accumulates
build output and it is precisely the one exempted from the walk.

**The drift report understates drift.** `global_package_toolchain_digests`
memoizes per process, so the pre- and post-build keys *necessarily* agree about
global inputs even when the tree moved underneath. The report now re-reads them
uncached and says so.

**The documented cheap provisioning path and the documented freshness gate are
mutually incompatible.** `install_local_binary` stages a kernel with no custom
sections, so `verify-fresh` then fails and points the reader at the expensive
path they were told not to run. Only the local-build engine stamps.

# LANE P — platform honesty

**Status: NOT CHARACTERIZED. Do not dispatch.** Findings below are evidence,
not a plan; each needs an end state, increments and acceptance before anyone
builds.

Every item here is the platform-values contract's own prohibition — presenting
capability or state that does not exist:

- **Six of twelve `MountSource` kinds have no implementation**, yet are offered
  in a config dropdown, allow-listed as untrusted input, and displayed as
  `gitfs` / `casfs` / `cryptfs`.
- **`web-libs/kandelo-session` reports the requested boot descriptor as machine
  state** in the production Inspector UI, while the kernel has a real
  `/proc/mounts`.
- **`MountConfig.readonly` renders as `ro` and gates nothing.**
- **16 declared-but-unimplemented surfaces, four of which contradict
  `docs/posix-status.md`.**
- **`st_rdev` is zero for every device node** through `stat`, `fstat`, `lstat`
  and `statx` alike — `process_wire.rs` calls it "unsupported" and requires it
  zero-initialised, so this is a declared gap rather than an oversight, and
  closing it is ABI-adjacent work on the stat wire.

---

# LANE I — host import surface

**Status: NOT CHARACTERIZED. Do not dispatch.** This lane is V4 itself and
deserves the most careful characterization of any of them.

Evidence gathered, not yet a plan:

- **27 of 72 host imports are deciding or mis-shaped.** An import that *decides*
  is policy in the host, which every new host must then re-implement correctly
  or silently not.
- **`host_waitpid` is implemented four times**, and the JS copy is dead.
- **17 further duplicated authorities, three already drifting** — including
  `host-native` discarding `clock_id`, which makes `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
  non-monotonic **on the conformance host**.
- **Five further dead Rust floors.**

The reduction pattern that works is on the record: `host_blob_read` and
`host_fetch_archive` were one capability split across two id namespaces that
genuinely overlap, and collapsed into `host_fetch_deferred(kind, …)`. Two
independent reductions composed to 73 only because **both measured the built
artifact** rather than reporting the pin.

---

# LANE T — test hygiene

**Status: characterized, blocked on a clean suite read.**

T1 and T3 closed with B19/B23 and B21. T4 is ~20 residual items — 7 `vi.fn`
stubs never called, 5 unreachable branches, assorted — explicitly sequenced
**after** T1–T3 because most should vanish with them. Dispatching it before a
clean suite read would be tidying a list rather than fixing a suite.

Current suite state on a correctly staged kernel: **83 failing files, 139

# LANE H — browser

**Status: DEPRIORITIZED by the maintainer.** *"I don't care about browser
coverage yet — I'd rather push implementation further before we pay the heavy
cost of checking in the browser."*

Recorded so it is not mistaken for an oversight: there is **zero browser
evidence on this branch**. Fourteen Playwright specs call `resolveBinary`
directly with no artifact reader installed; no `./run.sh browser` has completed;
no demo has been verified by hand. Everything else rests on Rust and Node.
Curation of ~369 commits into ~14 narrative commits also lives here, and the
maintainer has held it pending a running web app.

# Superseded

Deleted by the change that adds this file, their content carried above:

- `2026-09-10-rust-first-campaign-status.md` — the owed-work register and trap
  catalogue. **Its hazards are Hazards H-1 to H-7 above; its per-item history
  is in git.**
- `2026-09-11-fork-typescript-census.md`, `2026-09-11-unscoped-lane-survey.md` —
  evidence, folded into lanes F, V, P and I.
- `2026-09-07-fork-orchestration-migration.md`,
  `2026-09-08-fork-controlflow-into-module-scope.md`,
  `2026-09-09-rust-first-fork-inversion-completion.md` — folded into lane F.

**Explicitly NOT superseded**, because they are characterizations a future owner
needs whole:

- `2026-09-08-fork-controlflow-inversion-scope.md` — §2 and §3 are lane F's
  floor and target, derived from Wasm capability limits. Lane F's section here
  summarises it; it does not replace it.
- `2026-09-11-lane-a-state-of-the-lane.md` — lane M's handoff.
